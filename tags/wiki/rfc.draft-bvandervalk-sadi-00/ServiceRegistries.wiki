= Service Registries =

A service registry allows users to query metadata about a collection of services, in order to discover services that accomplish a task of interest. The implementation of service registries for SADI is beyond the current scope of the specification.  However, for the benefit of SADI users, the authors maintain a public registry of SADI services that may be accessed at http://sadiframework.org/registry.
