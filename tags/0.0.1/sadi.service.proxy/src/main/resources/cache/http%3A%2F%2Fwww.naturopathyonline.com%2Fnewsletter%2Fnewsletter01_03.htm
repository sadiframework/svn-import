        The people writing the books either don't regularly use the medicines

      <p class="bodycopy">This title really bugged me. It sounded so pretentious. 
        I figured it was just another M.D. with a cursory knowledge of natural 
        medicine writing another confusing book of misinformation for the general 
        public. Was I ever wrong! I've never met Dr. Hammerly, but I really like 
        the guy. He has a patient-centered approach that consists of a blend of 
        conventional and natural medicine. And he's candid - really candid. He 
        chides his medical colleagues when they ignore the centuries of benefits 
        of natural medicine because many of these modalities don't fit into the 
        research model of double-blind-placebo-controlled. &quot;A lack of research 
        does not mean a lack of results.&quot;And he urges the natural medicine 
        physicians to work better with the conventional physicians and stop fighting 
        within their own professions. But what does he say about fibromyalgia?</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Fibromyalgia is a medical condition characterized by 
        both generalized muscle pain and specific &quot;tender points&quot; of 
        pain. It also includes: muscle spasms, joint pains, skin and connective 
        tissue tenderness, numbness, tingling in the hands or feet, difficulty 
        sleeping, debilitating fatigue, anxiety, headaches, difficulty verbally 
        identifying objects, digestive problems, sensitivity to weather and temperature 
        changes, circulatory problems, upper respiratory problems, frequent of 
        chronic infections, food allergies, depression and trouble concentrating 
        or &quot;brain fog&quot;. And - the conventional medical community labels 
        it incurable.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Hammerly packs his book with excellent suggestions including 
        keeping a daily diary of symptoms to track the changes and perhaps patterns 
        in the pain, fatigue and other symptoms of fibromyalgia, avoiding or minimizing 
        flares, preparing for an office visit, exercising within the limitations 
        of the condition, and treating related problems such as increased sensitivity 
        to chemicals. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">One of the most unique aspects of this book is Hammerly's 
        understanding of both the harm and benefit of conventional medicine and 
        his honesty in writing it down. For example, he advises the patient with 
        fibromyalgia-related headaches not to rush for the ibuprofen or aspirin 
        because of the drugs' cumulative effects on the kidneys and liver as well 
        as their ability to cause rebound headaches. After listening to scores 
        of patients tell me that their conventional physicians denied any drugs 
        side-effects, it was refreshing that Hammerly wrote &quot;All conventional 
        medications can have potentially negative side-effects&quot;. But that 
        doesn't mean the natural medicine is without its own side-effects - especially 
        if not monitored by an experienced natural medicine physician. But it's 
        like comparing a tacking hammer to a sledge hammer, the potential damage 
        differs considerably.</p>
      <p><span class="bodycopy">His diet recommendations are equally excellent. 
        He is one of the few practitioners of either conventional or natural medicine 
        that recommends decreasing meat in the diet to lessen the pain, a move 
        supported by copious medical research.<br>
        <br>
        Also included under diet is food allergies/sensitivities. Many people 
        with fibromyalgia react to specific foods and need to figure out which 
        foods these are and to avoid them. The main culprits are chocolate, citrus, 
        coconut, coffee, corn, cow's milk, eggs, fish, mustard, peanuts, pork, 
        shellfish, soybeans, tomatoes, tree nuts, wheat and yeast. Hammerly urges 
        his readers to keep a diet diary to determine if certain foods affect 
        their symptoms.</span></p>
      <p class="bodycopy">My very few criticisms relate to his understanding of 
        homeopathy and botanical medicine. For example, he wrote that Siberian, 
        Panax and American ginseng have similar effects. As an herbalist, I disagree 
        with the general nature of this statement relating to this condition. 
        Panax ginseng stimulates the adrenal gland and should be avoided or used 
        in minute amounts and then only under a physician's care as it can exacerbate 
        the condition. On the other hand, Siberian ginseng, or Eleuthrococcus 
        would be extremely beneficial. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Similarly, his explanation of homeopathy is extremely 
        rudimentary. I have treated people with homeopathic remedies and within 
        one to three months either substantially decrease their pain level and 
        go off or decrease conventional medications or go into long-term remission. 
        Also, he lists 3 remedies and their potential benefit for the symptoms 
        of fibromyalgia. One of them, Rhus tox. is derived from poison ivy. For 
        people sensitive to poison ivy, if you repeat this remedy too much, they 
        may develop a pseudo case of poison ivy complete with itching and swelling. 
        There are similar cautions for the other two remedies.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">However, other than these minor complaints, I think 
        this is a terrific book. If you or someone you know wants to purchase 
        a single reference book for Fibromyalgia, then purchase this one. It's 
        the best, by far, of any book I have read on the condition.</p>

      <p class="bodycopy"><span class="bodycopy">Most of us think of depression 
        as an individual's process. The person periodically descends into an impenetrable 
        gloom and then, hopefully, recovers with medication or time. Challenging 
        this perception of depression, Dr. Beardslee describes depression as a 
        family illness. Labeling it an illness similar to diabetes or heart disease 
        but with a far worse stigma, he compassionately describes its effect on 
        all family members, especially the children, and proceeds to guide the 
        reader on how to protect and strengthen the child. So why am I including 
        a book on the effect of parental depression on children in a newsletter 
        about natural medicine? I guess because depression is so rampant and whether 
        you treat it, as a natural or conventional practitioner, it is still very 
        important to be aware of and minimize its effect on children.</span></p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Parents with depression often question their ability 
        to be successful parents. How can they raise healthy, emotionally-balanced 
        children, when they have so little control over their own emotional health? 
        Just as the person who has recently suffered a heart attack expects to 
        take time to completely recover, Beardslee urges the depressed person 
        to be patient with himself and to &quot;see depression for what it is 
        - a serious illness that need not destroy the capacity to be a good parent.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p class="bodycopy"> In Out of the Darkened Room , Dr. Beardslee discusses 
        &quot;resilience&quot; in children and how to develop it. Resilient children 
        share certain characteristics: good relationships with others, capacity 
        to get tasks accomplished, and self-understanding. Resilient children 
        can distance themselves from the depression of the parent and move on 
        with their own lives. Children with little resilience get mired in guilt 
        and tend to blame themselves for their parent's depression. They cling 
        to the depressed parent with fears and insecurities of their own - an 
        overwhelming burden to the parent already taxed by depression.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">To break this cycle and get the children on a stronger 
        emotional footing, Beardslee leads the family through a series of meetings 
        in order to expose the depression and to develop coping skills. He explains 
        that depression &quot;almost always starts as a series of disjointed incidents 
        in the life of the individual sufferer, experiences that cause the sufferer 
        to feel alone.&quot; Breaking the silence of depression by talking about 
        those incidents, he makes an opening for a real discussion that exposes 
        the fears and lack of understanding on the part of both the children and 
        the parents. To this end, he gives detailed advice on when, where and 
        how to hold the meetings. He even includes passages on getting children 
        reluctant to participate involved in the process. By naming the behavior 
        as depression instead of &quot;mommy is having a bad day: or &quot;daddy 
        is going to the hospital for a rest&quot;, Beardslee enables the child 
        to have a better understanding of depression and therefore be less impacted 
        by it</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Out of the Darkened Room is a rare and insightful book 
        that is emotionally draining to read. As you read it, you are struck by 
        Beardslee's immense concern for the welfare of his patients. It's not 
        sugar-coated or written as an authoritative text. Instead, Beardslee describes 
        his process in helping his patients and their families with depression 
        as well as giving the reader a graphic insight into their children's thought 
        processes over many years. It's a tough book to read, but if you have 
        a family member with depression; it's worth the effort.</p>

      <p class="bodycopy"><span class="newshead">Herb &amp; Health Tip: </span><span class="bodycopy">Here 
        is the second installment of the herbal cautions being sent around the 
        Internet.</span></p>
      <p class="bodycopy">&quot;St. John's Wort - Avoid mixing with any prescription 
        medications. In particular, avoid taking St. John's Wort (SJW) and:<br>
        a. Antidepressants<br>
        b. B. Indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), a protease inhibitor used to treat 
        HIV<br>
        c. Digoxin (Lanoxicaps, Lanoxin), a drug used to increase the force of 
        contraction of heart muscle and to regulate heartbeats<br>
        d. Theophylline (Slo-bid, Theo-Dur) an asthma medication<br>
        e. Cyclosporin (Neoral, Sandimmune, SangCya), an immunosuppressant<br>
        f. Chemotherapy</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">SJW has been shown to affect your body's metabolism 
        of all of these drugs. Many other drugs are likely to be affected too. 
        Until more is know about SJW's ability to alter the metabolism of pharmaceutical 
        medications, it is probably best not to combine such medications with 
        SJW.<br>
        Also, the combination of SJW with some antidepressants, such as selective 
        seratonin reuptake inhibitors, may cause an excess of seratonin (seratonin 
        syndrome). Typical symptoms include headache, stomach upset and restlessness.&quot;</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Let me tell you about Hypericum, also known as St. John's 
        Wort. My reference is The Principles and Practice of Phytotherapy by Simon 
        Mills and Kerry Bone.* </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">St. John's Wort's chief action is as an antiviral. It 
        has demonstrated its effectiveness in vitro and in clinical practice against 
        herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, parainfluenza virus, vaccinia virus, 
        and several other variations of enveloped viruses. (&quot;Enveloped&quot; 
        simply describes the structure of the various viruses.) It also demonstrated 
        potent activity in the test tubes and in humans against several retroviruses, 
        including HIV. This anti-retrovirus activity increased with exposure to 
        light. That means St. John's is a great herb to use for many, but not 
        all viruses.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Secondarily, St. John's Wort has antidepressant activity 
        through many mechanisms. It inhibits uptake of noradrenaline, seratonin 
        and dopamine in humans. It is a weak MAO inhibitor. &quot;Results from 
        comparative trials suggest that Hypericum (St. John's) may work as well 
        as standard antidepressants.&quot; St. John's Wort can be used for mild 
        to moderate depression and is inappropriate for severe depression.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Thirdly, St. John's Wort has demonstrated anticancer 
        activity (human stomach and colon cell lines) without any toxic effects 
        on normal cells. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Additionally, St. John's extract has shown to be effective 
        against a number of bacteria (Gram negative and gram-positive) including 
        Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">St. John's Wort has low toxicity. Prolonged use may 
        result in a state of sensitivity to sunlight. The concern about liver 
        toxicity refers to a study of HIV-positive patients who had mild reversible 
        liver enzyme elevations that returned to baseline after discontinuation 
        of St.John's Wort. After reviewing 3250 patients using St. John's, 2.4% 
        experienced either minor stomach upset or an allergic reaction such as 
        itchiness. This is 10X less than the side effects normally protracted 
        with orthodox antidepressants.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">So what does this mean? St. John's Wort has demonstrated 
        anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anticancer and anti-depressant activity with 
        a potential of 2.4% of those taking it getting some sort of minor side 
        effect that reverses with discontinuation. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Should it be used with anti-depressants? Probably not. 
        It's better to try a good quality St. John's for 4-6 weeks and then to 
        move onto the conventional drugs.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Should it be used with Indinavir? I worked at an HIV 
        clinic for two years. We used St. John's with great results right alongside 
        conventional anti-virals with no adverse interaction. The major side-effects 
        of Indinavir are headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and 
        insomnia. Again, after consulting with your physician, you may consider 
        trying a good quality St. John's Wort with regular monitoring.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">What about Digoxin and St. John's? This is probably 
        referring to a small (162) study of in which St. John's demonstrated its 
        ability to promote stable heart function while decreasing depression. 
        So, yes, it's an herb trying to stabilize the organism and may tonify 
        the heart. This is a beneficial side effect.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Why is Theophylline, primarily an asthmatic drug, listed? 
        Probably for the same reason as digoxin. Theophylline can cause life-threatening 
        ventricular arrythmias. (And frankly, don't use St. John's when using 
        Theophylline because if the ventricular arrythmias occur, St. John's will 
        be blamed.)</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Should St. John's be used with immune suppressants such 
        as Cyclosporin? Absolutely not. The overwhelming majority of medicinal 
        herbs should be avoided with immune suppressants. Herbs strengthen the 
        human organism. They would work directly against drugs designed to weaken 
        the human organism.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">What about using St. John's with chemotherapy? In my 
        practice, I tend to avoid most herbs during the actual process of chemotherapy. 
        I use them before hand to build up the body and afterward to repair the 
        damage to the normal cells. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Periodically, the pharmaceutical industry feels threatened 
        by a natural product and goes after it in a very deliberate way. About 
        10 years ago, it was L-Tryptophan. L-Tryptophan was an inexpensive amino 
        acid that was extremely effective in increasing seratonin levels and was 
        virtually without side effects. A Japanese company produced a single bad 
        batch after failing to complete the chemical process and several deaths 
        occurred. The FDA was able to trace the bad batch back to the Japanese 
        company, but still decided to ban the supplement. <br>
        Two years ago, the media flooded the public with warnings that St. John's 
        Wort would cause birth control pills to fail resulting in a host of unwanted 
        pregnancies. When the pregnancies didn't occur, the pharmaceuticals tried 
        a different angle. If it were patentable and the pharmaceutical companies 
        could make money off of it, this Internet email warning about herbs would 
        not have occurred. Consider Viagra. It has caused over 60 deaths and continues 
        to be on the market.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">*The specific section on St. John's Wort that I am referencing 
        is supported by 120 medical citations from various international medical 
        and scientific sources such as The Lancet, Antiviral Research, Pharmocychiatry, 
        The First National Conference on Human Retroviruses and Related Infections 
        (1993), AIDS Treatment News and about 80 European medical journals (whose 
        titles I was unable to translate). (The U.S. government has only recently 
        established funding for researching unpatentable natural medicine while 
        the European, Chinese, Japanese and Australian governments have provided 
        this for years.)</p>
