#summary Metadata specification for SADI services

= Service Metadata =

The metadata for a SADI service is an RDF graph which provides information that is potentially helpful to human and/or software clients attempting to use the service.

The root URI of the metadata graph MUST be the URL of the service. 

The following items MUST be provided in the metadata:
 
  * Input OWL Class -- an OWL class describing the expected structure of the input RDF graphs consumed by the service
  * Output OWL Class -- an OWL class describing the expected structure of the output RDF graphs generated by the service 

The following items MAY be provided in the metadata:

  * Service Name -- a human readable label for the service
  * Description -- a human readable description of the service functionality
  * Contact E-mail Address -- an e-mail address where the provider of the service may be contacted
  * Parameter OWL Class -- an OWL class describing execution parameters for the service
  * Default Parameter Graph -- an instance of the Parameter OWL Class which provides default values for the service execution parameters
  * Service Type URI(s) -- one or more rdf:type URIs indicating the type of service.  These URIs may be used to categorize the service by a wide variety of criteria, such as the task performed, the algorithm utilized, or the intended users of the service. 
  * Unit Test(s) -- One or more input RDF graph(s) that MUST constitute valid input(s) to the service. The expected output RDF graphs corresponding to these input graphs MAY also be provided. 
  * Authoritative Flag -- A boolean value that MUST be true if the person or organization hosting the service is also the author of the data or software underlying the service.  If a SADI service acts as an interface to third party data or software, the value of the authoritative flag MUST be false.    

In addition, any other data deemed useful to clients of the service MAY be included in the service metadata.

== Retrieving Service Metadata ==

An RDF document containing the metadata graph MUST be retrievable by an HTTP GET request to the service URL.  

The GET request MAY include a `Accept` header indicating the desired RDF serialization format for the response document.  A SADI service MUST support content types of `text/rdf+n3` for N3 and `application/rdf+xml` for RDF/XML, and MAY support additional content types for these formats or for any other RDF serialization formats.  In the event of an omitted, unrecognized, or unsupported content type, the default content type MUST be RDF/XML.
 
== Representing Service Metadata in RDF ==

The structure of the metadata graph is beyond the scope of the SADI specification. The service provider may use any graph structure deemed suitable, provided the root URI of the structure is the service URL.
