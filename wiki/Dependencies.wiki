#summary Instructions for downloading SADI dependencies

To alleviate network problems cause by an entire roomful of people downloading dozens of files at the same time, please use the instructions on this page to pre-install various SADI dependencies.

= Java dependencies =

If you have Maven 2 working from the command line:
  # download http://sadiframework.org/downloads/sadi-service-skeleton-0.1.0.zip
  # unzip that file and open a shell in the resulting `sadi-services` directory
  # execute the following command:
    {{{
$ mvn ca.wilkinsonlab.sadi:sadi-generator:generate-service -DserviceName=hello -DserviceClass=com.example.HelloWorldService -DinputClass=http://sadiframework.org/examples/hello.owl#NamedIndividual  -DoutputClass=http://sadiframework.org/examples/hello.owl#GreetedIndividual -DcontactEmail=nobody@mailinator.com
    }}}
    (you've just built a SADI service)
  # execute the following command:
    {{{
$ mvn org.mortbay.jetty:jetty-maven-plugin:run
    }}}
    (you're now running a SADI service and will therefore have downloaded all the dependencies)

If you have Maven 2 working in Eclipse:
  # download http://sadiframework.org/downloads/sadi-service-skeleton-0.1.0.zip
  # import the project in that file into your workspace (using *File &raquo; Existing Projects into Workspace*)
  # execute the *generate sadi service* run configuration (using *Run &raquo; Run Configurations...*)
  # execute the *run sadi services in Jetty* run configuration (using *Run &raquo; Run Configurations...*)

Otherwise:
  # download http://sadiframework.org/downloads/sadi.libraries.2011-05-19.zip
  # unzip that file and move the contents of the resulting `repository` directory; if you can't figure this out, it's enough to have downloaded the file — an instructor can help you tomorrow.

= Perl dependencies =

  # execute the following command (this is in an interactive process and can take a long time):
{{{
$ perl -MCPAN -e "install SADI"
}}}

= Ontologies =

  # download http://sadiframework.org/downloads/training1105-ontologies.zip
  # that file should contain the following ontologies:
    * http://sadi-ontology.semanticscience.org/pharmacogenomics-depression-sadi.owl 
    * http://sadi-ontology.semanticscience.org/pharmacogenomics-complex-sadi.owl
    * http://sadi-ontology.semanticscience.org/pharmacogenomics-primitive-sadi.owl
    * http://ontology.dumontierlab.com/biomedical-measure-primitive
  # unzip that file and put the ontologies somewhere you can easily find them
