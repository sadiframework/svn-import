#summary Proposal for modeling sequence features in RDF/OWL

= Proposal for Modeling Sequence Features in RDF/OWL =

The motivation for these RDF/OWL models is the development of [ServicesForGMOD SADI services for GMOD].  

= Genomic Regions =

A genomic region is a contiguous chain of residues within a biological molecule (e.g. a chromosome).

The location of a genomic region is described by a ranged sequence position consisting of:

  * a *start position*: the index of the first base / amino acid
  * an *end position*: the index of the last base / amino acid
  * a *strand*: the '+' or '-' strand of the containing double-stranded DNA/RNA molecule
  * a *reference feature*: determines the frame of reference for the start and end coordinates

The '+' strand of a chromosome corresponds to the sequence that is stored in the database. We use the same conventions as GMOD when we wish to describe the location of a genomic region on the '-' strand. That is to say, we give the start and end coordinates with respect to the '+' strand, but indicate that the region is on the '-' strand. To obtain the sequence for a region on the '-' strand, we must reverse the direction of the sequence on the '+' strand and take the genetic complement.
  
For example, if we have a short chromosome 'chr1' represented by:

AGCTAGCTAGCT

then a region with coordinates (start,end) = (2,6) on the minus strand of 'chr1' has the sequence: 

CTAGC

= Features =

A feature is a typed genomic region. Examples of features are chromosomes, genes, and transcription factor binding sites. 

Every feature has:

  * an *rdf:type* (e.g. 'gene'), taken from the [http://purl.org/obo/owl/SO# OWL version of the Sequence Ontology]
  * a *ranged sequence position*, as described above 

In addition, most features will have a public database identifier, which will be typed according to its corresponding namespace in the [http://lsrn.org LSRN registry].

== Example Feature in RDF/N3 ==

Below, we give the RDF/N3 representation of a tRNA gene in the Drosophilia melanogaster (fruitfly) genome with identifier FlyBase:FBgn0011935.  This gene is located on the right arm of chromosome 2 ('2R'), which has the identifier GB:AE013599. (GB is the identifier namespace for the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Consortium, consisting of GenBank, ENA, and DDBJ.)

Note that the RangedSequencePosition for chromosome '2R' (GB:AE013599) is the full length of the chromosome  (1 .. 21146708), and that this range is defined relative to the sequence for the chromosome's plus strand.

Note also that some statements are included at the end which relate a sequence to its strand, and which relate a strand to its chromosome. These connections are necessary for determining the identifier of the reference feature, which is needed for any useful processing of a RangedSequencePosition (e.g. retrieving the sequence from a GMOD database.)

One unresolved issue regarding the example above is that the URIs for the plus/minus strand sequences do not  resolve to anything.
