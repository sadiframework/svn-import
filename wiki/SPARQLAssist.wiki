#summary SPARQL Assist language-neutral query composer

= Introduction =

SPARQL Assist is a web application that provides context-sensitive type-ahead completion during SPARQL query construction.

= Details =

[http://code.google.com/p/sadi/downloads/detail?name=sparql-assist-0.1.3.zip Download the JavaScript-only distribution of SPARQL Assist].  This version is easier to deploy, but you must be able to access entities and their labels in JSON format.

[http://code.google.com/p/sadi/downloads/detail?name=sparql-assist-0.1.3.war Download the Java servlet distribution of SPARQL Assist].  This version requires a servlet container (e.g.: Tomcat, Jetty) to deploy, but can use OWL ontologies directly as sources of entities and their labels and can dynamically parse ontologies that appear in the FROM clauses of SPARQL queries.

= Examples =

The pages below contain self-documenting examples of SPARQL Assist running in various situations.  Look at these if the documentation in the distribution is insufficient to get you up and running.
