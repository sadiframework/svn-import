= Introduction =

Some service developers may wish to test their SADI services with the SHARE client locally before publicly registering them.  In order to do so, you'll have to set up a local registry and configure the SHARE client to use it.

= Setting up a local SADI registry =

Download the [http://code.google.com/p/sadi/downloads/detail?name=sadi-registry-0.0.5.war sadi-registry webapp] and deploy it to a servlet container.

Once it is unpacked, edit the sadi-registry/WEB-INF/classes/sadi.registry.properties file to match your desired persistence configuration.

= Configuring the SHARE query client to use your local SADI registry =

Create a file in your home directory called sadi.properties and add your local registry to it as follows:
{{{
# add a local registry read from a SPARQL endpoint
sadi.registry.local = ca.wilkinsonlab.sadi.client.RegistryImpl
sadi.registry.local.endpoint = http://biordf.net/sparql
sadi.registry.local.graph = http://sadiframework.org/registry/

# add a local registry read from a JDBC database
sadi.registry.local = ca.wilkinsonlab.sadi.client.RegistryImpl
sadi.registry.local.driver = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
sadi.registry.local.dsn = jdbc:mysql://localhost/test_registry
sadi.registry.local.username = sadi
sadi.registry.local.password = ******

# add a local registry read from a file
sadi.registry.local = ca.wilkinsonlab.sadi.client.RegistryImpl
sadi.registry.local.file = /tmp/sadi-registry.rdf
}}}

Run the SHARE command-line client as normal and it should use your local registry in addition to the default SADI registries.  If you wish to use _only_ your local registry, add the following to your sadi.properties file:
{{{
sadi.registry.biomoby.exclude = true
sadi.registry.sparql.exclude = true
sadi.registry.sadi.exclude = true
}}}
