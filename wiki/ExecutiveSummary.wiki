= Executive Summary =

SADI is a set of best practices for implementing stateless web services that natively consume RDF data as input and generate RDF data as output. Its primary purpose is to increase the interoperability of services across independent providers. Under SADI, the schemas for the input and output RDF data of a service are defined by the service's _input OWL class_ and _output OWL class_, respectively. Provider-specified metadata about a service, including the URIs of the input and output OWL classes, is published as an RDF document that is retrievable by an HTTP GET on the service URL.  Service invocation is accomplished by issuing an HTTP POST request to the service URL with an appropriate input RDF document as the request body.  The input RDF document contains one or more individuals of the input OWL class which represent independent inputs to the service.  In response, the service returns an output RDF document with corresponding individuals of the output OWL class. Each output individual has the same root URI as its corresponding input individual, in order to ensure that the data consumed and generated by the service are explicitly linked.
