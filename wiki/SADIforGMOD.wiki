#summary SADI for GMOD: Services for the Generic Model Organism Database

= Introduction =

SADI for GMOD is a collection of ready-made SADI services for accessing sequence feature data in RDF form. The services were developed as an add-on for the GMOD (Generic Model Organism Database) project, which is a popular toolkit for building model organism databases and their associated websites (e.g. FlyBase).
