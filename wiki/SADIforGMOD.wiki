#summary SADI for GMOD: Services for the Generic Model Organism Database

= Introduction =

SADI for GMOD is a collection of ready-made SADI services for accessing sequence feature data in RDF form. The services were developed as an add-on for the GMOD (Generic Model Organism Database) project, which is a popular toolkit for building model organism databases and their associated websites (e.g. FlyBase).

= The Services =

SADI for GMOD provides five SADI services for accessing sequence feature data:

|| Service Name || Input || Relationship || Output ||
|| get_feature_info || database identifier || is about || feature description ||
|| get_features_overlapping_region || genomic coordinates || overlaps || collection of feature descriptions ||
|| get_sequence_for_region || genomic coordinates || is represented by || DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequence ||
|| get_child_features || feature description || has part / derives into || collection of feature descriptions ||
|| get_parent_feature || feature description || is part of / derives from ||  collection of feature descriptions ||

= Structure of Service Input/Output RDF =

The main entities of the service input/output data are features and genomic coordinates. For a detailed discussion of how these entities have been modeled, see [ModelingSequenceFeaturesInRDF Modeling Sequence Features in RDF].

= Setting up the Services =

The services are implemented as CGI Perl scripts. 

These instructions assume working apache and mysql installations. To set up the services:

  # *Load your GFF files into a `Bio::DB::Sequence::Store` database (mysql)*.  There are instructions for doing that on the GBrowse wiki: http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse_Backends#Using_Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store_with_the_MySQL_Backend.
  # *Install the SADI for GMOD depends with CPAN or your OS package manager*:
    * one
    * two
    * three
  # *Download the SADI for GMOD tarball and unpack into `cgi-bin`*: A subdirectory will be created called `sadi.gmod`.
  # *Set `Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store` connection parameters in `../cgi-bin/sadi.gmod/sadi.gmod.conf`. SADI for GMOD uses the GBrowse configuration format. There is documentation within the file to help with filling in each parameter.
