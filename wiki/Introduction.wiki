#summary Introduction for the SADI specification

= Introduction =

Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration (SADI) is a set of best practices for implementing stateless web services that consume RDF data as input and generate RDF data as output. The schemas for the input and output RDF data for a service are defined the service's _input OWL class_ and _output OWL class_, respectively.  

The RDF metadata for a SADI service, including the URIs of the input and output OWL class, is retrieved by issuing an HTTP GET request to the service URL.

A SADI service is invoked by issuing an HTTP POST request to the service URL, using an RDF document as the body of the request. The input RDF document may contain any number of instances of the input OWL class, which represent independent inputs to the service. The response is an RDF document which contains a corresponding number of instances of the output OWL class.  Related instances of the input and output OWL classes must have the same root URI, in order to ensure that the data consumed and generated by a service are explicitly linked by one or more RDF triples.
