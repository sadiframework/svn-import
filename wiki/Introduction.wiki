#summary Abstract for the SADI RFC

= Abstract =

This memo describes a set of best practices called SADI for implementing stateless web services that natively consume RDF data as input and generate RDF data as output. Under SADI, the schemas for the input and output RDF data of a service are defined by the service's _input OWL class_ and _output OWL class_, respectively. Metadata for a service, including the URIs of the input and output OWL classes, are retrieved by issuing an HTTP GET request to the service URL. SADI services are invoked by issuing an HTTP POST request to the service URL with an RDF document as the body of the request. The input RDF document may contain any number of instances of the input OWL class which represent independent inputs to the service. The service's response is an RDF document which contains a corresponding number of outputs which are instances of the output OWL class.  Related instances of the input and output OWL classes always have the same root URI, in order to ensure that the data consumed and generated by a service are explicitly linked by one or more RDF triples.
