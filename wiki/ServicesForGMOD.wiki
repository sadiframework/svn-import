#SADI Services For GMOD

= Introduction =

We are currently developing SADI services to be included with the GMOD (Generic Model Organism Database) project: http://gmod.org. GMOD is a popular toolkit for setting up a model organism database and associated website. Prime examples of GMOD users are [http://flybase.org FlyBase], [http://wormbase.org WormBase], and [http://yeastgenome.org SGD].

= Ideas for Services =

= Sequences and Features =

The core data in GMOD are sequences and sequence annotations (i.e. "features"). This part of the database is described by the [http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_Sequence_Module Sequence Module] of [http://gmod.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Chado Chado]. ("Chado" is the database schema for GMOD.)      

  * get_sequence_for_region (Ben): retrieve a sequence for a given genomic region (e.g. bases 3012 to 4192 on chromosome 'chrIX').
  * get_features_overlapping_region (Ben): retrieve all features overlapping a given genomic region
  * get_features_contained_by_region (Ben): retrieve all features completely contained by a given genomic region
  * get_features_containing_region (Ben): retrieve all features that completely contain the given genomic region
  * get_child_features (Ben): retrieve features that are immediate children of a given feature (e.g. exon features are children of mRNA features)
  * get_parent_features (Ben): retrieve features that are immediate parents of a given feature
  * get_descendant_features (Ben): retrieve features that are descendants of a given feature
  * get_ancestor_features (Ben): retrieve features that are ancestors of a given feature
