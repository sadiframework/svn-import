        >BackgroundHuman African trypanosomiasis is a severely neglected vector-borne disease that is always fatal if untreated. In Tanzania it is highly focalised and of major socio-economic and public health importance in affected communities.ObjectivesThis study aimed to estimate the public health burden of rhodesiense HAT in terms of DALYs and financial costs in a highly disease endemic area of Tanzania using hospital records.Materials and MethodsData was obtained from 143 patients admitted in 2004 for treatment for HAT at Kaliua Health Centre, Urambo District. The direct medical and other indirect costs incurred by individual patients and by the health services were calculated. DALYs were estimated using methods recommended by the Global Burden of Disease Project as well as those used in previous rhodesiense HAT estimates assuming HAT under reporting of 45%, a figure specific for Tanzania.ResultsThe DALY estimate for HAT in Urambo District with and without age-weighting were 215.7 (95% CI: 155.3?287.5) and 281.6 (95% CI: 209.1?362.6) respectively. When 45% under-reporting was included, the results were 622.5 (95% CI: 155.3?1098.9) and 978.9 (95% CI: 201.1?1870.8) respectively. The costs of treating 143 patients in terms of admission costs, diagnosis, hospitalization and sleeping sickness drugs were estimated at US$ 15,514, of which patients themselves paid US$ 3,673 and the health services US$ 11,841. The burden in terms of indirect non-medical costs for the 143 patients was estimated at US$ 9,781.ConclusionsThis study shows that HAT imposes a considerable burden on affected rural communities in Tanzania and stresses the urgent need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates tailored to particular rural settings in countries like Tanzania where a considerable number of infectious diseases are prevalent and, due to their focal nature, are often concentrated in certain locations where they impose an especially high burden. Author SummarySleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis - HAT) is a disease transmitted by tsetse flies and is always fatal if left untreated. The disease occurs in foci affecting poor communities with limited access to health service provision and as such the disease is often left undiagnosed, mistaken for more common afflictions. Even if diagnosed, sleeping sickness is costly to treat, both for health services and patients and their families in terms of costs of diagnosis, transport, hospital care, and the prolonged period of convalescence. Here we estimate the health burden of the ?acute form? T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness in Urambo District, Tanzania in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), the yardstick commonly used by policy makers to prioritize disease management practices, representing a year of healthy life lost to disease. In this single district, the burden of the disease over one year was estimated at 979 DALYs and the estimated monetary costs to health services for the 143 treated patients at US$ 11,841 and to the patients themselves at US$ 3,673 for direct medical costs and US$ 9,781 for indirect non-medical costs. Sleeping sickness thus places a considerable burden on the affected rural communities and health services.</j.0:SIO_000300>

        >The exosome complex is a key component of the cellular RNA surveillance machinery and is required for normal 3? end processing of many stable RNAs. Exosome activity requires additional factors such as the Ski or TRAMP complexes to activate the complex or facilitate substrate binding. Rrp47p promotes the catalytic activity of the exosome component Rrp6p, but its precise function is unknown. Here we show that recombinant Rrp47p is expressed as an apparently hexameric complex that specifically binds structured nucleic acids. Furthermore, pull-down assays demonstrated that Rrp47p interacts directly with the N-terminal region of Rrp6p that contains the functionally uncharacterized PMC2NT domain. Strains expressing a mutant form of Rrp6p lacking the N-terminal region failed to accumulate Rrp47p at normal levels, exhibited a slow growth phenotype characteristic of rrp47-? mutants and showed RNA processing defects consistent with loss of Rrp47p function. These findings suggest Rrp47p promotes Rrp6p activity by facilitating binding via the PMC2NT domain to structural elements within RNA. Notably, characterized Rrp6p substrates such as the 5.8S+30 species are predicted to contain helices at their 3? termini, while others such as intergenic or antisense cryptic unstable transcripts could potentially form extensive double-stranded molecules with overlapping mRNAs.</j.0:SIO_000300>
