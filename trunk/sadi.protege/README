***** COMPILE SADI PLUGIN AND RUN PROTEGE *****
The steps (and items) needed to compile the SADI plugin for protege 4.1+.

1. Download the protege source plugins [1]

2. Follow the guide 'Setup and run the Protege 4 OWL editor from Eclipse'[2]
   Once you can run protege from eclipse, proceed to the next step.

3. Checkout the SADI plugin from the google code SVN. 

4. Run protege from within eclipse to play around with the SADI plugin.
   NOTE: the ant build file will automatically copy over the SADI plugin
         archive file to ${PROTEGE_HOME}/plugins, so make sure to specify
         PROTEGE_HOME in your environment.
