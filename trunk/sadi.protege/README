***** COMPILE SADI PLUGIN AND RUN PROTEGE *****
The steps (and items) needed to compile the SADI plugin for protege 4.1+.

1. Download the protege source plugins [1]

2. Follow the guide 'Setup and run the Protege 4 OWL editor from Eclipse'[2]
   Once you can run protege from eclipse, proceed to the next step.

3. Checkout the SADI plugin from the google code SVN. 

4. Run protege from within eclipse to play around with the SADI plugin.
   NOTE: the ant build file will automatically copy over the SADI plugin
         archive file to ${PROTEGE_HOME}/plugins, so make sure to specify
         PROTEGE_HOME in your environment.

***** What are the x.launch files? *****

We have included some launch configurations to help you use the plugin while
developing it. They can be found in the home directory of the plugin source code.

***** HOW TO CREATE A RELEASE OF THE SADI PLUGIN *****

1. CD into the root project directory (i.e. svn/trunk/sadi.protege/).

2. Open build.xml and update the version properties as you see fit. For example, 
to make a version 2.1.0 release, you would edit the build.xml as shown below:
    <property name="major.version" value="2"/>
    <property name="minor.version" value="1"/>
    <property name="micro.version" value="0"/>

3. Having saved and closed the build.xml file, you will need to now build the 
project. From the console, type:

    ant clean install

this will compile your changes and create the sadi.protege.jar file. In addition,
the update.properties file will also be updated. This file is used by protege to
determine when it should notify users of a new version of the plugin.

4. Update the version-info.txt file. This file holds the Change log for the SADI
plugin. When users consider upgrading their version of the SADI plugin, this file
will be shown to them.

5. {optional} Test the plugin. Download the latest version of Protege (4.1+) and
copy the sadi.protege.jar file into the plugins directory. Make sure that everything
works as expected.

6. Commit sadi.protege.jar, update.properties and version-info.txt to the SVN.
Protege will notice that the plugin has changed and notify current users of the
update.
