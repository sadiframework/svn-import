<h2>SADI Plugin For Protege (requires JAVA 1.6)</h2>
<p>The SADI plugin for Protege is a collection of views, available in a single tab, that simplify
the provision of SADI services.</p>
<p>Available to SADI service authors are views that:
<ul>
    <li>generate service skeleton code in either JAVA or Perl,</li>
    <li>generate JAVA classes or Perl modules from OWL entities for use with SADI services,</li>
    <li>enable the testing of SADI services with input taken from the currently opened ontology or from files.</li>
</ul>
</p>
