Revision history for Perl extension OWL2Perl.

0.98
	* updated the version of PLUTO that we require.
	
0.97

    THIS RELEASE requires that you re-generate all of your OWL2Perl modules!
    
    * fix: when bnodes with properties were added to a class, they had extra
        stuff being added as well.
    * fix: some ontologies caused owl2perl to serialize very slowly; modified
        owl-class.tt to speed up _get_statements.
    * added a method called clear_statements that removes the statements generated
        when you use OWL::Utils::serialize or _get_statements.
    * fix: when parsing ontologies, we ignore restrictions that dont act on
        specific (declared) properties.
    * fix: when some classes were generated, they had the same property added
        greater than once. Duplicates should be filtered out now.
    * added a 'strict' paramter to OWL::Data::OWL::Class that enables/disables
      constraint checking (defaults to false)
    * added a 'model' parameter to generated classes that is of type RDF::Core::Model.
      This model is populated in calls to get_statements.
    * removed 'statements' parameter from generated classes.
    * internal subroutine '_get_statements' now returns an RDF::Core::Enumerator object
    * better handle of OWL classes that are equivalent to anonymous classes with
      someValueFrom restrictions.
    * Utils->serialize() updated to use our RDF::Core::Enumerator rather than an
      arrayref of statements
    * Updated the perldoc for generated classes
    * added a __properties method that keeps track of the object and datatype properties
      that a particular class has. This information is kept in a hash with keys: 
      datatypes and objects;
    
    TODO - cardinality constraints are now broken for classes that declare the same
          property > once. 
0.96
    * fix uri2package: packages had # or / appended on odd uris ... broke
      our generated package names
    * added tests for uri2package
    * updated some of the tests that create files and/or directories
      to do better post test cleanup
    * for those owl classes that have owl:hasValue restrictions, they
      are now added to the generated OWL class (values are now automatically
      added).
    * added some newlines in our test OWL/RDF documents to test for text content
      handling.
    * added some new tests for hasValue processing
    * Version for OWL2Perl.pm matches version of cpans OWL2Perl distribution.
    * added cardinality constraints (if they exist) for class properties. exceptions
      are thrown now if you exceed the constraints when adding properties to classes. 
    
0.95
    * generate modules script now checks to see whether or not the
      install script has been run.
0.94
    * updated version of PLUTO required to 0.26

0.93
    * added 'use OWL::RDF::Predicates::*' statements to owl-class.tt
    
0.92
    * separated the logic contained in owl2perl-generate-modules.pl and placed
      it into the OWL2Perl module.
    * added some test cases for the OWL2Perl
    * Revamped the OWL2Perl pod

0.91
    * created a serialize method in OWL2Perl::Utils that
    serializes a list of OWL::Data::OWL::Class objects

0.90 
    * First version of this module
