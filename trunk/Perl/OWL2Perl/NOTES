Here are some notes strictly for developers of this
OWL2Perl module!

If you plan on modifying this distribution and you
obtain the code from a repository and NOT from CPAN,
please make sure that you have Module::Install
installed on your machine!

Other than that, if you are maintaining this module,
you need to make sure that you never commit the
following files:

    META.yml, MANIFEST

Basically, the files are created when you plan on
creating the distribution file for upload to CPAN.

Assuming you want to create the distribution, do*:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make manifest
   make distribution
   make realclean

A OWL2Perl-###.tar.gz (where ### is the version number)
file can then be found from the ./ directory. Upload
this file to cpan.


* Of course, I didn't mention that you need to update
the version of the distribution in the Makefile.PL file.
If you don't, then you wont be able to upload to CPAN.

Good luck!

Eddie
