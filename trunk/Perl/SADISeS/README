OVERVIEW

Perl SADI is a generator of Perl based SADI
web services (CGI based). This module
will hopefully help all those service providers
that have something to offer, but don't want to
get overwhelmed by the SADI services protocol.

Perl SADI takes care of all data marshalling and
un-marshalling, web service transporting, and much
more, leaving the service provider the sole task 
of providing the business logic for their service.
