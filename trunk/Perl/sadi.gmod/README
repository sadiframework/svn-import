SADI for GMOD: version 0.1.1

Introduction
------------

SADI for GMOD is a collection of ready-made SADI services for accessing sequence feature data in RDF form. The services were developed as an add-on for the GMOD (Generic Model Organism Database) project, which is a popular toolkit for building model organism databases and their associated websites (e.g. FlyBase?).

The Services
------------

SADI for GMOD provides five SADI services for accessing sequence feature data:

Service Name                        Input                   Relationship                Output
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
get_feature_info                    database identifier     is about                    feature description
get_features_overlapping_region     genomic coordinates     overlaps                    collection of feature descriptions
get_sequence_for_region             genomic coordinates     is represented by           DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequence
get_child_features                  feature description     has part / derives into     collection of feature descriptions
get_parent_feature                  feature description     is part of / derives from   collection of feature descriptions

Structure of Service Input/Output RDF
-------------------------------------

The main entities of the service input/output data are features and genomic coordinates. For a detailed discussion of how these entities have been modeled, see http://code.google.com/p/sadi/wiki/ModelingSequenceFeaturesInRDF.

Setting up the Services
-------------------------

The services are implemented as CGI Perl scripts.

These instructions assume working apache and mysql installations. To set up the services:

   1. Load your GFF files into a Bio::DB::Sequence::Store database (mysql). There are instructions for doing that on the GBrowse wiki: http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse_Backends#Using_Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store_with_the_MySQL_Backend.

   2. Install the SADI for GMOD dependencies with CPAN or your OS package manager:
          * Bio::DB::SeqFeature?::Store
          * Log::Log4perl
          * Template
          * RDF::Trine
          * RDF::Query
          * OBO::Core::Ontology
          * File::Spec
          * URI
          * Storable 
          * Config::IniFiles 

   3. Download the SADI for GMOD tarball and unpack into cgi-bin: A subdirectory will be created called sadi.gmod.

   4. Set Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store connection parameters in cgi-bin/sadi.gmod/sadi.gmod.conf. sadi.gmod.conf uses the GBrowse configuration format for configuring data sources. Synopsis:

      [GENERAL]
      db_adaptor = Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store
      db_args = -adaptor DBI::mysql
                -dsn dbi:mysql:database=flybase
      base_url = http://flybase.org/cgi-bin/sadi.gmod/

   5. Configure database crossreference (dbxref) mappings in cgi-bin/sadi.gmod/dbxref.conf. The mapping indicate how dbxref prefixes in the local database should be translated to standard namespaces in the LSRN (Life Science Resource Name) registry. Synopsis:

      [DBXREF_TO_LSRN]
      SwissProt = UniProt
      UniProtKB = UniProt
      SwissProt/TrEMBL = UniProt
      ...

   6. Register the services in the public SADI registry. (TODO: A script will be provided for this purpose.)
