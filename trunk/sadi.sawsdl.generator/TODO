TODO 

* *Get all info from the sawsdl, do not store lifting/lowering 
*   locations (currently execution of service uses sawsdl; 
*   looking up signature does not)
* 
* 
* *Currently, no forward/back/reload functionality in WSDL2SAWSDL, this is impt
* 
* *Look through source and remove extraneous classes; there are many of these
* 
* *Look through source for places where we have TODOs for exception handling and
*   handle the exceptions
*
* *Support for wsdl 2.0 ... we can parse 2.0, but we need to add the correct annotations (http://wso2.org/repos/wso2/people/jonathan/flickr.wsdl)

* 
* Update the UI for the generator page:

*   # add buttons to go forward and back (input/output mapper may be tough, but not impossible, to implement)
*   # remove comments from the templates
*   # clean up the http GET method so that each step calls out to a method (makes code more readable)
*   # remove indentation for input/output mapper 
*   # (make each text box disabled after a property has been added)

Below is a description of what I was thinking, as well as some links to 
resources that may be useful. Additionally, there is a link to the KEGG 
wsdl and some example inputs for some of their services.

*
* better way to map prefixes/suffixes, etc for input/output mapper
