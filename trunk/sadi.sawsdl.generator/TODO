TODO 

* *Get all info from the sawsdl, do not store lifting/lowering 
*   locations (currently execution of service uses sawsdl; 
*   looking up signature does not)
* 
* 
* *Currently, no forward/back/reload functionality in WSDL2SAWSDL, this is impt
* 
* *Look through source and remove extraneous classes; there are many of these
* 
* *Look through source for places where we have TODOs for exception handling and
*   handle the exceptions
*
* *Support for wsdl 2.0 ... we can parse 2.0, but we need to add the correct annotations (http://wso2.org/repos/wso2/people/jonathan/flickr.wsdl)
* 
* Add support for parsing complicated data types from WSDL (currently only handles 
* 
* Update the UI for the generator page:
*   # make sure that all of the templates have the ability to insert default values
*   # add buttons to restart process (restart button that clears session)
*   # add buttons to go forward and back (input/output mapper may be tough, but not impossible, to implement)
*   # remove comments from the templates
*   # clean up the http GET method so that each step calls out to a method (makes code more readable)
*   # remove indentation for input/output mapper 
*   # (make each text box disabled after a property has been added)

Below is a description of what I was thinking, as well as some links to 
resources that may be useful. Additionally, there is a link to the KEGG 
wsdl and some example inputs for some of their services.

* better way to map prefixes/suffixes, etc for input/output mapper

WSDL/SOAP 2 SADI
* 
* **** WSDL ****
* 
* Document style passes XML documents around
*     will use the mapping element in the lowering schema to construct the soap service input
* 
* RPC encodes the params:
*     if 1 param, then pass string as is
*     if > 1 param, then need to pass an array of strings
*     probably wont use the mapping element of the lowering schema
* 
* 
* **** SAWSDL ****
* Document contains the model references and schema mappings
*   Model references point to input and output OWL classes
*   schema mappings define how to do SADI->SOAP and SOAP->SADI
* 
* 
* *************** How does the service use the loweringSchemaMapping? *********************
* loweringSchemaMapping points to an XML file
*   this XML file contains a root element "lowering" and at most 2 child elements
*     sparqlQuery - the query that we will use to extract the data
*           -> 
*     template - an optional velocity template that is used to construct the SOAP input
*       if mapping is missing, it is assumed that the result from the sparql query should
*         be passed to the soap service as is (one at a time)
* 
*
* 
* *************** How does the service use the liftingSchemaMapping? *********************
* liftingSchemaMapping points to an XML file
*   this XML file contains a root element "lifting" and two child elements:
*     template - a velocity template that is used to construct the service output
*       the template uses N3 notation to construct the output
* 
*     mapping  - a way of mapping SOAP output results to variables for our velocity template.
*       example: 
*         <mapping>
*           <map id="$pathway" type="string">path:hsa04370</map>
*           <map id="$drugResults" type="xpath">XPATH that returns an array of drug ids (extracted from soap service output)</map>
*           <map id="$drugResults" type="regex">regular expression that returns an array of drug ids (extracted from soap service output)</map>
*         </mapping>
