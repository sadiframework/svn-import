DB01323,St. John's Wort,DB00091,Cyclosporine,Y,DDI_00051,DDI_00055,We present a case of a probable drug interaction between St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) and cyclosporine in a patient with a combined kidney and pancreas transplant. This patient presented with significantly subtherapeutic cyclosporine concentrations soon after beginning a self prescribed regimen of St. John’s wort; she subsequently developed acute cellular rejection of the transplanted organs.,DDI_00054,10981246
DB01323,St. John's Wort,DB00091,Cyclosporine,Y,DDI_00051,DDI_00055,"Cyclosporine, a widely used immunosuppressant for transplantation, is a substrate of P-gp and CYP3A4. Therefore, the induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp by SJW may reduce the plasma level of cyclosporine, leading to rejection of a transplanted organ.",DDI_00054,22139684
DB01323,St. John's Wort,DB00864,Tacrolimus,Y,DDI_00051,DDI_00055,"studies suggest that SJW may induce CYP3A4 and P-gp in a clinically relevant manner, thereby re- ducing the efficacy of co-medications. Drugs that are likely to interact include the immunosuppressants cy- closporine and tacrolimus, the HIV protease inhibitor indinavir, the HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor ne- virapine, the antineoplastic drugs irinotecan, imatinib mesylate, the benzodiazepines alprazolam, midazolam, and quazepam, amitriptylline, digoxin, fenoxfenadine, methadone, simvastatin, omeprazole, theophylline, ve- rapamil, and warfarin.",DDI_00054,22139684
