DB01323,St. John's Wort,DB00091,Cyclosporine,Y,DDI_00051,DDI_00055,We present a case of a probable drug interaction between St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) and cyclosporine in a patient with a combined kidney and pancreas transplant. This patient presented with significantly subtherapeutic cyclosporine concentrations soon after beginning a self prescribed regimen of St. John’s wort; she subsequently developed acute cellular rejection of the transplanted organs.,DDI_00054,10981246,,,Y,N
DB00091,Cyclosporine,DB01323,St. John's Wort,Y,DDI_00055,DDI_00051,"Cyclosporine, a widely used immunosuppressant for transplantation, is a substrate of P-gp and CYP3A4. Therefore, the induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp by SJW may reduce the plasma level of cyclosporine, leading to rejection of a transplanted organ.",DDI_00054,22139684,,,N,Y
