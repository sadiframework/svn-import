DB01323,St. John's Wort,DB00091,Cyclosporine,Y,DDI_00051,DDI_00055,We present a case of a probable drug interaction between St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) and cyclosporine in a patient with a combined kidney and pancreas transplant. This patient presented with significantly subtherapeutic cyclosporine concentrations soon after beginning a self prescribed regimen of St. John’s wort; she subsequently developed acute cellular rejection of the transplanted organs.,DDI_00054,10981246

Since discharge, her theophylline concentrations were lower than desired and resulted in dosage in- creases ≤1600 mg/d. This dosage produced a steady-state theophylline concentra- tion of 9.2 µg/mL. During the interview, the patient noted that the only new addi- tion to her medication regimen was 300 mg/d of a St. John’s wort supplement standardized reportedly to 0.3% hypericin, which she began taking approximately two months prior to this evaluation. Her other medications included furosemide, potassium, morphine, zolpidem, valproic acid, ibuprofen, amitriptyline, albuterol, prednisone, zafirlukast, and inhaled triamcinolone acetonide. In addition, she smoked one-half pack of cigarettes per day. Because St. John’s wort was the only agent added since problems arose with her theophylline concentrations, the patient decided on her own to discontinue the St. John’s wort. A theophylline concentra- tion measured seven days later was 19.6 µg/mL, and her dosage was consequently adjusted downward.",DDI_00054,10332544
