Description
===========

This directory provides a script for generating SADI BLASTP services from UniProt FASTA files.  The main script is generate-uniprot-blastp-services.pl, which generates a separate BLAST database and Perl SADI service for each organism in the input UniProt FASTA file(s).  It is useful to split up the sequences into separate BLAST databases because the memory footprint for querying over the entire UniProt database at once is enormous (~ 10GB).  It also allows the queries to run significantly faster.
